                <h2>The Good Ole Days</h2>
                <p>The VOX AC30 has been in production since the early 1960's. These amps were originally made by Jennings Musical Industries, the first model shipping out in 1960. In the 1970's, VOX was bought by Dallas Arbiter. This would be the steady decline in quality for all VOX products, but would ultimately keep the company alive long enough for it to be bought once again. In 1993, VOX was bought by KORG. This was the real turning point for the AC30, as KORG would revisit the old way of making the amp.   </p>

                <h2>The Original 1960's AC30</h2>
                <p>There are many good reasons why the original 1960's AC30 models are still praised as the best of the lineup. Perhaps the most significant part of the originals were the GZ34 rectifier tubes that gave the tone a much more compressed sound. The original 1960's models also came with a pair of speakers called "Blue Bulldogs," manufactured by Celestion as the Alnico Blues. In the 1970's, costs were cut when the rectifier tube and valves were replaced by cheaper diodes and semi-conductors. As well as these cuts, the Alnico Blues were also replaced by a cheaper made Celestion Greenback loudspeaker.   </p>
