            <p>As a nod to the original, the Alnico Blues made by Celestion made a comeback in the TBX models. The TB/6 models still came with the Greenbacks, making it the only difference between the two models of the era.</p>

                <h2>Back to the Original</h2>
                <p>In 1993, VOX was purchased by Korg, a keyboard manufacturing company. Korg would be the last company in England to make the AC30, ending in 2004. During the Korg era, the VOX AC30 was as close to the original 1960's amp as it could be. The TB/6 and TBX models of the AC30 were produced as a reissue of the original, bringing back the valves and GZ34 rectifier compression. These amps can be found for sale on Reverb going for $1,100-$1,900. If you are after that original tone, this will be the closest out of all the models you will find.   </p>

                <h2>Made by Marshall</h2>
                <p>All AC30s made during the 1993-2004 era were manufactured in England by Marshall. These would be the last VOX amps made in England, and an end to a great era.</p>
