            <p>In 2004, the production of Vox amps moved to China. For a few years, the amps were only recieving updates, but costs would soon start to be cut again with the removal of the GZ34 once more</p>

                <h2>The Custom Classic</h2>
                <p>In 2004, the production of Vox amps moved to China. The first model produced would be the Custom Classic Series. These amps had features that were seen as boutique, including two channels, a bright switch, a top boost knob, trebal knob, as well as other pre-amp eq. While some people will say that this amp pales in comparison to its predicesors, this model also happens to be the best selling AC30. This model also came with Celestion Neodog Loudspeakers, a reverb tank, stereo output, bias switches and more! You can also find this amp in a head and cab version, as well as a 1x12 model. </p>

                <h2>The Current Models</h2>
                <p>While you can still find many of these amps in the marketplace, many of them have been discontinued. The Handwired version of these heads are the only models not built in China. They are the new Flagship of the Vox AC30. The Custom Classic now has a head version and is under the model CC2. The GZ34 has unfortunately been eliminated from these models once more. </p>
